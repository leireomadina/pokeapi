# Server - Node.js

This folder contains a **Node.js** script used to generate a json of pokemon data.
It makes three calls to different **pokeapi** endpoints to collect and transform the data we need on the front end.

Note that this script was created using **18.18.0** Node.js version


## Setup

Run the following command in your terminal to generate the json. It will be stored directly on the data folder of the client.



```sh
npm run start
```
